CONSTEQ - A program for association constants determination using solution NMR data

CONSTEQ is a program developed in our group to determine association constants from NMR titration experiments using a non-linear regression algorithm. We use it essentially to determine binding constants of supramolecular inclusion compounds of cyclodextrins, at 1:1 stoichiometry. The implemented algorithm performs a global analysis, simultaneously fitting multiple experimental datasets.
